During the implementation, I briefly entered a trial and error phase with the Snowflake connector, which politely refused to cooperate outside Python versions 3.8–3.12. After convincing it with the correct Python version, further negotiations revealed that every Snowflake resource (warehouse, role, database, schema) insists on being explicitly chosen, any missing one had to be removed from the secrets.toml file to avoid complaints. Finally, Snowflake made it clear that passwords were not welcome guests in the configuration file, and removing them resolved the remaining issues.
