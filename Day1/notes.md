During implementation, I briefly entered a trial-and-error phase with the Snowflake connector 🤹‍♂️, which refused to cooperate outside Python versions 3.8–3.12 🐍. Once the correct version was used, it became clear that all Snowflake resources (warehouse, role, database, schema) had to be explicitly specified 🧩, with unused entries removed from secrets.toml to avoid complaints 🗂️. Finally, removing password fields, clearly unwelcome guests 🚫, resolved the remaining issues ❄️✅.
