I did not face any major technical hurdles, but being new to IDEs, I had a brief moment of confusion figuring out how to run my Python script using streamlit run *.py instead of the usual run button 🤔. After a few curious clicks and some friendly trial-and-error, I discovered that creating a simple template was the easiest way to make peace with the IDE 🧘‍♂️. This small workaround saved time, reduced confusion, and made running Streamlit apps feel almost effortless 🚀😄.
