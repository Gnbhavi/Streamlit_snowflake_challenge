Just when things seemed smooth, I met another tiny hurdle 🧱. This time in the form of a brand-new package(snowflake-ml-python) that needed to be installed to make the Python API cooperate with Snowflake 🐍❄️. Once the package was in place (after a brief “why isn’t this working?” moment 🤨), everything fell into line. On the bright side, this setup allowed us to use multiple models to fetch and process queries efficiently, which turned out to be a win rather than a roadblock 🚀✨.
